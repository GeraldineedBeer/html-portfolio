<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been doing an amazing course on Web Development and it has helped me so much in putting my excitement for coding
  and Wev Development into my own projects and it is really helping me understand and gain more knowledge of how coding works.
</p>

<p>I have always loved working on a laptop, i always thoughgt it would be doing something like Admin or being a PA for someone
  where i can just sit at a desk and work on a laptop, but then i asked myself is this really what i want? No it was not, it was
  then that i relized why dont i look into Software Development and Web Development that i started thinking and learning This
  is what i want to do, this is what i always ment by sitting and working on a laptop.</p>

<p>My love for Web Development and Coding started when i saw a lot of vidoes on the internet about Coding and how interesting
  and exciting it looked like. It was then when i started with courses and reading Coding books online. It has giving me some
inspiration to continue with what makes me happy.</p>
